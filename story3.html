            <br><br>Horror films have existed for more than a century. Early inspirations from before the development of film include folklore, religious beliefs and superstitions of different cultures, and the Gothic and horror literature of authors such as Edgar Allan Poe, Bram Stoker, and Mary Shelley. From origins in silent films and German Expressionism, horror only became a codified genre after the release of Dracula (1931). Many sub-genres emerged in subsequent decades, including body horror, comedy horror, slasher films, splatter films, supernatural horror and psychological horror. The genre has been produced worldwide, varying in content and style between regions. Horror is particularly prominent in the cinema of Japan, Korea, Italy and Thailand, among other countries.
            <br><br>Despite being the subject of social and legal controversy due to their subject matter, some horror films and franchises have seen major commercial success, influenced society and spawned several popular culture icons.

        <h3>Elements of the Horror Genre</h3>
        <img src="./horror_main.jpeg" alt=""  align="right" class="image2">
        <p>At the heart of the horror genre lies a potent combination of fear, suspense, and dread, designed to keep audiences on the edge of their seats and their hearts racing with anticipation. Whether it's the jump scares of a slasher film or the slow-burning tension of a psychological thriller, horror stories are defined by their ability to provoke visceral reactions and elicit primal emotions.
            <br><br><b>1. Iconic Monsters:</b>From the immortal Dracula to the relentless Michael Myers, horror is defined by its iconic monsters and villains. Whether they're supernatural beings, deranged killers, or otherworldly creatures, these figures of terror haunt our nightmares and leave an indelible mark on our collective consciousness.
            <br><br><b>2. Atmospheric Settings:</b>From decrepit haunted houses to fog-shrouded graveyards, the setting plays a crucial role in establishing the atmosphere of a horror story. Whether it's the claustrophobic confines of a cabin in the woods or the isolation of a remote village, the environment serves as a canvas for the unfolding terror, heightening the sense of unease and dread.
            <br><br><b>3. Psychological Terror:</b>While jump scares and gore are staples of the genre, some of the most effective horror stories rely on psychological terror to elicit fear and discomfort. Whether it's the creeping dread of a supernatural presence or the existential horror of confronting one's own inner demons, psychological horror challenges our perceptions and preys on our deepest fears.
            <br><br><b>4. Subversive Themes:</b>Beyond its surface scares, horror often serves as a vehicle for exploring deeper themes and social issues. Whether it's the commentary on consumerism in "Dawn of the Dead" or the exploration of trauma and grief in "The Babadook," horror has the power to provoke thought and spark conversation about the darker aspects of the human experience.
